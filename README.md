# Updated-Portfolio-Page

The goal is too make my portfolio presentable! It has to include three projects/homeworks for now.
I do like to keep it simple, but have enough of features to show my skills.

Three added projects are:
1. Trivia Game
2. Project 1
3. Train Scheduler

The portfolio has three pages:
1. Home/portfolio page
2. About Me page
3. Contact Me page

Navigation Bar has animated tabs, which brings fun and visual satisfaction 
Home/Portfolio page has pictures/projects which ones clicked navigate to a particular project and GitHub link
About Me page has a picture and text about me
Contact Me page has my personal information: 
1. Email address
2. LinkedIn link
3. GitHub Link
4. Resume (pdf)

# Updated-Portfolio-Project will be added again soon, with more projects that i am proud of!
